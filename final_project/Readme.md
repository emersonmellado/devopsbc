Clarify what/how is going to be our final project

- Step by step on what we did already
- Ideas
    - You can register a free domain, use a free hosting and create a basic automation
    - You can create a step by step plan with any details you can thinkg about the step:
        i.e: If you have a step, register a domain: When registering a domain we have to go to a domain authority or domain provider and choose one of the available domains. They can have different extensions like .com, .ca, etc....
    - If you already have a real problem to solve, that is good too.
    - Clone any site you want: 
        - For example Spofity
        - You can also create an example store and automate its change

- Talk about support finishing your project
    - Let us know via slack and we can schedule a time for a call or whatever you need! The important thing is you learning!!!

- Review Ivan's summary of a path to keep studying
- Feedback plan for the end of our course and after.
    - The slack channel will be there (until January/21)
    - The github content will be available (until January/21)
    - The class recordings will be available (until January/21)
    :: We actually lost 3 classes due to CodeCast failures.

Goal: Showcase of what you have learned.
